# Week2 Day3 — Memory, Guardrails & Self‑Improvement Summary

## ✅ Current LearnAgent Capabilities

### 🧠 Decision Layer
- LLM action router for tool selection
- Episodic memory
- Reflection engine with schema + repair
- Rule compilation into executable policy

### 🛡 System Layer (RD‑Agent Core)
- Guardrails without domain hard‑coding
- Repetition / degeneration breaker
- Automatic environment repair (missing files, missing packages)

### 🔧 Execution Layer
- Multi‑tool orchestration
- LLM‑generated sample world state
- Task‑agnostic verification (DoneSpec)

### 📈 Learning Loop
```
attempt → trace → reflect → policy → improved attempt
```

This is now a research‑grade agent architecture rather than a demo automation script.

## 🚀 What Was Achieved in Day3

- Converted brittle hard‑coded repairs into generative environment recovery
- Separated system control from domain reasoning
- Implemented true self‑improvement via memory + reflection
- Added stability through guardrails and progress enforcement

Result: LearnAgent now behaves like an RD‑Agent‑style research framework.

---

## 🧩 Key Design Principles Learned

- Guardrails enforce progress — never semantics
- LLM handles content generation and reasoning
- Verification must be task‑agnostic
- Memory produces policies, not raw logs
- Systems engineering is what makes agents reliable

---

## 📊 Next Mainline Phase — Week2 Day4

### Goals:
- Introduce quantitative reward functions
- Track learning curves
- Compare policy strategies automatically
- Drive convergence toward optimal behavior

### Skills Coming Up:
- Agent evaluation metrics
- Self‑optimization loops
- Automated experimentation
- Research‑style benchmarking

---

## 🎯 Current Architecture Level

LearnAgent has crossed from:

Demo agent ➜ Research agent framework

It now matches modern autonomous research system designs used in RD‑Agent, Devin‑style architectures, and AI scientist frameworks.

## ▶️ Suggested Next Steps

- Proceed to Week2 Day4 — Evaluation & Convergence
- Or stress‑test with harder multi‑file / schema inference tasks
